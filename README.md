# GHCommitGraphAnimator
Displays Bad Apple on the GitHub commit graph using a web extension. Can also play sound.  
Contains Bad Apple in text form in `content.js`. I recommend opening it in VS Code.  
Most values are hardcoded. I might clean it up in the future. For now, it works, and that's enough for me.
